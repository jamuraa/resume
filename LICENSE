All of this data doesn't really apply to you, does it?  It's about me.

At the same time, licensing for random data which is available is important
because the intention of the author is important.  Michael Janssen knows about
how license intermingle and has worked on code that was under GPL, LGPL, BSD,
MIT, X11, Artistic, WTFPL, and other licenses.  I know how licenses work and
which ones can be mixed together without running afowl of the law.

Whatever you find useful in the form of text or whatever from
here that you want to reuse is fine by me.
