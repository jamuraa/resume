# Michael Janssen's Resume

Yes, I know that this isn't what people are usually talking about
when they refer to a "github resume".  It's a convenient way
for me to keep track of the data that I would sift through to
tailor a resume when it's needed.

This is meant to be mostly unabridged, so if you are looking at
it as a potential employer, you probably have a resume that only
has a subset of what is available here.  If I included everything,
my resume would both be too long and unfocused.
