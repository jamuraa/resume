# Michael Janssen's Resume

A convenient way for me to keep track of the data that I would sift through to
tailor a resume when it's needed.
Yes, I know that this isn't what people are usually talking about
when they refer to a "github resume".

This is meant to be mostly unabridged, so if you are looking at
it as a potential employer, you probably have a resume that only
has a subset of what is available here.  If I included everything,
my resume would both be too long and unfocused.

Eventually I might actually migrate this into some parseable format
so I can create custom resumes as a subset of all this data.

Note: Contact info is left out, but you can email me at m@base0.net
if you want.  I'm not currently actively looking
for a position, but I do have limited consulting hours available each week.
